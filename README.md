# Scratch Off

Scratch Off is the [Todo List Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) from 
[The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/).

Scratch Off allows users to create projects and create todos that belong to those projects.  Data is persisted between page refreshes with the browser's 
local storage.  The app was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The app itself is rendered almost entirely with Javascript.  The code was
structured using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern.  Webpack was used to bundle the individual javascript files.
